**Open-SymuVia** is an open-source traffic simulator. 
It compounds of:
- a dynamic microscopic traffic simulator based on the kinematic wave model with a Lagrangian resolution,
- a dynamic traffic assignment model based on users' equilibrium
- several useful tools to handle your simulations

Multiples components to reproduce urban networks (intersections, lane-changing, multi-class, etc.) are embedded in **Open-SymuVia**. It computes position, speed and acceleration of each vehicle on the network with a 1 second resolution.
